# Simple React Sample

This is a simple React sample that demonstrates the use of some basic React concepts, such as components, state, and props.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of code that can be used to create different UI elements.

In this sample, there are three components:

* `Counter` - A component that displays a counter and allows the user to increment or decrement the counter.
* `DisplayStudent` - A component that displays a student's name and age.
* `StudentList` - A component that displays a list of students.

## State

State is a way to store data in a React component. It is used to keep track of the current state of the component, such as the value of a counter or the list of students.

In this sample, the `Counter` component uses state to store the current value of the counter. The `StudentList` component uses state to store the list of students.

## Props

Props are a way to pass data from one component to another. They are used to share data between components, such as the name and age of a student in the `DisplayStudent` component.

In this sample, the `DisplayStudent` component uses props to receive the name and age of a student from the `StudentList` component.

## How to run the sample

To run the sample, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the application:


npm install
npm start
```

The application will be started at http://localhost:3000.
